# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple, command-line-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java.

## Description

This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other in the console. The game board is a 3x3 grid, and players take turns marking a cell with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Compile the Java code:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `Tic Tac Toe Game` directory, and run the following command:
    ```sh
    javac TicTacToe.java
    ```

2.  **Run the game:**
    After successful compilation, run the game with this command:
    ```sh
    java TicTacToe
    ```

## How to Play

1.  The game will start, and the board will be displayed.
2.  Player 'X' goes first.
3.  You will be prompted to enter your move by providing the row and column number (from 0 to 2).
4.  The players will take turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
5.  The game will announce the winner or declare a draw.
